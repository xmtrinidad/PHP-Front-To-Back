# PHP-Tutorials

This repo originally started as documenting from one tutorial, but I converted it to keep track of my learning progress as I go through various PHP tutorials I come across.

My main goal is to be primarily project focused because I beleive that's where I learn the most, but it's important to keep learning things.  As I go through PHP tutorials, I will link to any projects I create here.
