# Section 3 - Building a Photo Gallery System

This section mainly focused on refactoring code from the template, including making code more manageable by moving them into their own files and including them where they're needed.

Although there wasn't much OOP done in this section, I still found the process of breaking things down into components, to make things more maintainable.

This section also created a ```gallery_db``` database and a ```users``` table.  This was done through phpMyAdmin for a quick set up.
